# <a title="United States Covid-19 Activity LSTM Time-Series Model"> United States Covid-19 LSTM Time-series Model</a>

The New York Times is releasing a series of data files with cumulative counts of coronavirus cases in the United States, at the state and county level, over time. 
This time series data form state and local governments and health departments have been compiled and can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fireballbyedimyrnmom/us-counties-covid-19-dataset) to provide a complete record on the ongoing pandemic activity int he United States. 

Since late January, The Times has tracked cases of coronavirus in real time as they were identified after testing. Because of the widespread shortage of testing, however, the data is necessarily limited in the picture it presents of the outbreak.

I have used the counties dataset to build a LSTM model to predict the future trajectory of new Covid cases for each state.
